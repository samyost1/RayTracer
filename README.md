# RayTracer
A simple Ray Tracer made from scratch in C++ as part of a C++ course for Applied Computer Science at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. The Ray Tracer renders two images:
one in grayscale (image.bmp), and one in color (imageColor.bmp). The image consists of a floor with a checkerboard pattern and three spheres floating above it. The dimensions, positions and colors of the floor and spheres can be changed in main.cpp.
